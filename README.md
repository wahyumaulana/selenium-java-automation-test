# Selenium + Java Automation Framework

This project contains a hybrid automation framework for testing the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website. It is implemented using the Page Object Model (PO
M) design pattern and built with Maven.

## Features

- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Maven for project management and dependency resolution
- Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- Java for writing test scripts
- TestNG for test execution and reporting
- Extent Reports for detailed test reports

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven
- WebDriver compatible with your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
$ cd selenium-java-automation-test
```
3. Install dependencies using Maven
```sh
$ mvn clean install
```
   

### Running Test
To execute the automated tests, run the following Maven command:
```sh
$ mvn test
```
TestNG will run all tests specified in the testng.xml located in `test/resources`

or you can run specific test
```sh
$ mvn -Dtest=LoginTest test 
```

### Viewing Test Reports
After running the tests, you can view the detailed test reports generated by Extent Reports. 
Open the generated HTML report (extent-report.html) located in the test-output directory in your web browser.
